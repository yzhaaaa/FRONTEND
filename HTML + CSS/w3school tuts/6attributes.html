We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes
    The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.

    The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.

    However, W3C recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, and demands lowercase attributes for stricter document types like XHTML. 

We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values
    The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.

    However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.

Sometimes you have to use quotes. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space
<p title=Description of W3Schools>

Single or Double Quotes?
